## Problem

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

For example:

2, [[1,0]]

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1]


4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]

There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is[0,2,1,3].

Note: The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.

[See at Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)

## Notes

*	It's a directed graph problem, scince the vetices may have their parent pointing at them. So generate the graph first.

    The graph is mainly an array of vectors:

~~~
    0: 1, 2 (course 0 has two prerequisites: course 1 and course 2)

    1: 3

    2: 7
~~~

* Use depth-first-search to check if the graph contains a circle. If yes, it means "it is impossible to finish all courses".

## Solution

~~~ c++
class CourseSchedule2 {
public:
  std::vector<int> findOrder(int numCourses, std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& prerequisities) {

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> graph(numCourses);
    std::vector<int> mark(numCourses);
    std::vector<int> res = std::vector<int>();

    // a directed graph to save every vetex and it's adjescent vetex.
    for (auto item : prerequisities)
    {
      graph[item.first].push_back(item.second);
    }

    // loop through the graph
    for (size_t i = 0; i < graph.size(); i++)
    {
      std::vector<int> temp(numCourses);

      // if any vertex of the graph can't not be visited by vistiGraph, then return an empty vector
      if (!visitGraph(graph, i, mark, temp, res))
      {
        return std::vector<int>();
      }
    }
    return res;

  }

    const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& graph,
    int pos,

  A function to visit the graph
  Params:
    graph: the whole graph

    res: the result vector.

  return:
    bool
  */
  {
    // if the vertex has been visited, return true.
    if (mark[pos] == 1)
    {
      return true;
    }

    // if the vertex has no adjescent vetices, marked it as visited.
    else if (graph[pos].empty())
    {
      mark[pos] = 1;
      res.push_back(pos);
      return true;
    }

    // if the vertex has adjescent vetices
    else
    {
      // loop through all the adjescent vetices
      for (size_t i = 0; i < graph[pos].size(); i++)

        }
        else
        {
          temp[graph[pos][i]] = 1;
          if (visitGraph(graph, graph[pos][i], mark, temp, res))
          {
            // if the vetex can be visited, then unmark its temporary mark
            // in order to check the cycle in the next loop.
            temp[graph[pos][i]] = 0;
            continue;
          }
          else
          {
            return false;
          }
        }

      }
      mark[pos] = 1;
