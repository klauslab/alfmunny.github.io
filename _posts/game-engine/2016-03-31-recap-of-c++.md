{% include toc.html %}

The whole series are mostly notes of Youtube Videos in Channel [TheChernoProject](). 
I found it very helpful in learning C++ and game engine, because I'm also a newbie in this field.
I will try to give references or maybe dig more for some import concepts.

This will be a really quick recap of C++. It assumes you have already basic understanding what is C++ and some programming experience of it.
It refers only some essential basics and features which might be useful in following programming. 
But all in all, it doesn't hurt by reading this when you just start learning C++.


## Main Function

A simple HelloWorld function of C++.

{% highlight C++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std:cout << "Hello World!" << std:endl;
  system("PAUSE");
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}


`std:cout`: standard output. You can also just write `std:cout << "Hello World"`.

`std:endl`: break the line.

`<<`: operator overload. Don't worry about it, we will talk about in the future. 

`return 0`: return an integer. 0 means a proper exit. 

Now you can just consider it as a push method of the standard output.
Output can be "pushed" into `std:cout` with `<<`.

Arguments could be given to main function like this.

{% highlight C++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *args[])
{
  std:cout << "Hello, " << args[1] << std:endl;
  return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

`argc`: counter of arguments.

`args[]` : arguments array.

## Data Type

{% highlight C++ %}

int a = 1; // 4 bytes
unsigned int a = 1;       // a can't be negative
signed int a = 1;         // a can be negative
unsigned long a = 1;      // 4 bytes, C++ compiler doesn't make it 8 bytes
unsigned long long a = 1; // 8 bytes, you have to use long long to make it 8 bytes
float f = 1.0f;           // 4 bytes
double d = 0.0;           // 8 bytes

sizeof(int)               // check out the size of data type

{% endhighlight %}

## Preprocessor

C++ has preprocessor. It runs before the code get compiled.

`#` is the term for the preprocessor contents.

### include and define
What `#include <iostream>` do is only copy the code of 'iostream' into the current file. `#define` does almost the same
thing.

##### Example

`header.h`
{% highlight C++ %} 
void print()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
}

{% endhighlight %}

`main.cpp`
{% highlight C++ %} 
#include <iostream>
#include "header.h"

int main()
{
  print();
  system("PAUSE");
  return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}


But it also works this way, only to present what I mean by simply copying the data.

`header.h`
{% highlight C++ %} 
}
{% endhighlight %}

`main.cpp`
{% highlight C++ %} 
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  print();
  system("PAUSE");
  return 0;
#include "header.h"
{% endhighlight %}


### if

The statement `#if` can make a piece of code not to be compiled.

{% highlight C++ %} 
#include <iostream>
#include "header.h"
#define DEBUG 1

int main()
{
#if DEBUG
  print(); //It won't be compiled.
#endif
  system("PAUSE");
  return 0;
#include "header.h"
{% endhighlight %}


## Prototype

The compiler compiles the code from top to bottom. So you can't call a function which is not defined before. To solve 
this you can have a prototype of this function. The prototype is an empty function with the data type of the paramters 
under the same name which you later want to implement. 

##### Example

{% highlight C++ %}

void a(int d); //prototype, return value, name, and parameters.

int main()
{
  a();
  system("PAUSE");
  return 0;
}

void a(int d)
{
  std::cout << "The number is" << d << std::endl;
}

{% endhighlight %}


## Pointer

Pointer is sometimes confusing. It should be considered as a memory address, nothing more.
With pointer you can reference the memory address of a data. 
A data type followed a "*" makes the variable a pointer.

##### Example

{% highlight C++ %}

int main()
{
  int a = 5;
  int* p = &a; // int* make the p a pointer(a memory address). So the right value should be the memory address of a.
  std::cout << p << std::endl; 
  std::cout << *p << std::endl;
  
  *p = 6;
  std::cout << a << std::endl;
}

{% endhighlight %}


Output:

`0052FD28` the value of `p`, the memory address of `a`.

`5` the value of `a`

`6` the value of `a` has changed, because `p` points to the same memory which a holds.


Take a look at this function.


{% highlight C++ %}
int increment(int a)
{
  a++; // it's a copy of a, has it's own memory block. 
}

int main()
{
  int a = 5;
  increment(a)
  std::cout << a << std::endl;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Output:

`5` the value of `a`is not changed.

A paramter passed into function only gets its copy passed. 
The copy doesn't affect the actual data which you have passed into.

So if you want to write a function to pass the data and change its value, 
you have to pass the memory address of the data.

{% highlight C++ %}
int increment(int* a)
{
  (*a)++; //Notice: here a is only the memory address of the data. You have to dereference it using '*' to access the actual data.
}

int main()
{
  int a = 5;
  increment(&a)
  std::cout << a << std::endl;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Output:

`6` the value of `a` gets changed.

## Reference

You have seen that passing the data using pointer seems not so straight away. 
C++ provides a better way to write such a function. It's called reference.

{% highlight C++ %}
int increment(int& a) // using & to pass the data by reference
{
  a++;
}

int main()
{
  int a = 5;
  increment(a)
  std::cout << a << std::endl;
}
{% endhighlight %}


Output:

`6`


Reference is supposed to be used when you want to modify the data you are passing.

Notice: once a reference variable has been signed, it can not be resigned.

{% highlight C++ %}

int main()
{
  int a = 5;
  int& r = a;
  int b = 10;
  r = b;
  std::cout << a << std::endl;
}
{% endhighlight %}


Output: `10` 

The value of `a` has been changed. `r = b` does not resigned `r` to the address of `b`, 
but simply changed the value of `a` to `b`.


## Constant

`const` can forbid changing of data.

{% highlight C++ %}
int increment(const int& a) // the value of a can't change.
int increment(const int * p) // p(the memory address) can be changed, the data which p points at can't be changed.
int increment(int * const p) // p(the memory address) can't be changed, the data which p points at can be changed.
int increment(const int* const p) // both the pointer and the data can't be changed.

int main()
{
  int a = 5;
  increment(a)
  std::cout << a << std::endl;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Class

{% highlight C++ %}

class Entity()
{
private:
  int x, y;
  
public:
  Entity(int x, int y)
  {
    this->x = x;
    this->y = y;
  }
  
  int getX() const { return x; } //this method does not modify the members
  int getY() const { return y; } //this method does not modify the members
}
{% endhighlight %}

There are two ways to create an instance of the class.

One is to create on stack. The allocated memory will be freed when the main scope ends.
{% highlight C++ %}

int main()
{
  Entity e(3, 4)
}

{% endhighlight %}

One is to create on heap. You have to delete the instance manually, otherwise you will get a memory leak.

{% highlight C++ %}

int main()
{
  Entity* e = new Entity(3, 4)
  delete e;
}

{% endhighlight %}

### overload, override, hide 

#### overload

Define the same method but with different types of parameters. It's called overload.


{% highlight C++ %}

class Entity()
{
public:
  void f1()
  {
    std::cout << "fun1" << std::endl;
  }
  
  void f1(int a)
  {
    std::cout << "fun2" << std::endl;
  }
  
  void f1(float a) // same number of parameters, but different type
  {
    std::cout << "fun3" << std::endl;
  }
  
  bool f1(int a, float b) // different parameters, and different return value as well
  {
    std::cout << "fun4" << std::endl;
    return true;
  }
  
}

int main()
{
  Entity e;
  
  e.f1()
  e.f1(1)
  e.f1(0.5)
  e.f1(1, 0.5)
}

{% endhighlight %}


Outputs:

`fun1`

`fun2`

`fun3`

`fun4`

#### override

To understand override, you have to understand why we need override. Basically it makes it possible that the children 
of the same parent class can have the same method but behave differently. It's also called polymorphism.

Imagine you have a group of animals, which are just all different kinds, and you just want to iterate them 
by simply calling something like `for every animal in animals, please eat.`. Of course, they eat differently. 
So you can define the eat() function differently in the derived class, and call it by referring its parent. 
You don't have to know which type of the child is.
