Hello, I'm Yuanchen, programmer living in Munich.

I'm recently interested in game engines and computer graphics.

I'm working mainly with python and C#.
I've also done some projects with C++, Ruby and javascript.

I watch a lot of films. My favorite director is Yasujiro Ozu from Japan. His films have always
been helping me through hard times. And of course I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder.
Edting videos has made me a lot of fun.

Quote the final line from Holden, "Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody".

Weil ich hungern muss, ich kann nicht anders.

Quel est votre plus grande ambition dans la vie?
devenir immortel. Et puis: mourir.

戦おう、ここがオレたちの世界。オレたちはこの世界で生きて、行かなければならないのだから

一点浩然气，千里快哉风。
