Hello, I'm Yuanchen, a programmer living in Munich.

I'm recently interested in game engines.

I'm working mainly with python and sometimes C#. Python is a great language to learn machine learning.
I've also done some projects with C++, Ruby on Rails, Ember.js and Meteor.js.

I watch a lot of films, 2000+ I think. My favorite director is Yasujiro Ozu from Japan. His films have always 
been helping me through hard times. And of course I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder. 
I must stop to list the director names, since it's not gonna be an end. 
I like to edit videos with iMovie, pretending that I'm editing some awesome film.

Chinese is my mother tongue. My working language is German. I also speak English, some Japanese and a little French.
It means, I speak Chinese, German, bad English and I can't speak Japanese and French. 

I read a lot of books, but I've forgotten most of them. I used to keep notes about some books in my early days. 
Whenever I read them, driven by some unknown impulsion now and then, I'll laugh to death. 

Quote the final line from Holden, "Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody". 

戦おう、ここがオレたちの世界。オレたちはこの世界で生きて、行かなければならないのだから
